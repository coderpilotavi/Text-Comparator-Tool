# 📝 Text Comparison Tool

A **responsive web app** that allows users to compare two blocks of text side-by-side and **highlight word-level differences** in real time. Built using **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap** — with no external backend or dependencies required.

## 🚀 Why I Built This

While revising my web development concepts, I encountered bugs in my code. After receiving help from teachers in a supportive Discord server, I wanted to compare my version with theirs efficiently. So I decided to build a tool that makes code/text comparison simple and visual — and this project was the result.
